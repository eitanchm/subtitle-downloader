00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,389
Can't talk. Meditating.

331
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:02,043
You must be at the end of your rope.
You hate meditating.

332
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,291
I thought that if I really tried,

333
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,918
I might be able to contact
my past Avatars.

334
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,640
Someone who knows something
to help me.

335
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,622
But I can't.

336
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:13,389
They're gone and I'm all alone.

337
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:18,163
Did I ruin everything by leaving
the spirit portals open?

338
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,705
You didn't ruin anything.

339
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,982
You did what you thought was best
for the world.

340
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:25,435
And now things have changed.

341
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,825
Change can be good or bad,

342
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,470
depending on your point of view.

343
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:30,663
[Sighs]

344
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,822
I know the people's point of view.

345
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:35,456
- It's bad.
- You're not the president, Korra.

346
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:38,098
Your job isn't to fix the daily problems

347
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,294
of every person in Republic City.

348
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:45,111
Your responsibility is to bring balance
to the entire world.

349
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:47,087
And that means no matter
what you do,

350
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,727
some people are not going to be
happy about it.

351
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,653
Great.

352
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,838
On the other hand, some people will be
very happy,

353
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,052
like me.

354
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,793
What you did during Harmonic Convergence,

355
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,614
may have brought back the Air Nation.

356
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,604
And that can only be good for
restoring balance.

357
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:05,834
That is the act of a great Avatar.

358
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,173
It's scary.

359
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,828
I have all this power and all these
people depending on me,

360
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,512
but I don't know what I'm supposed
to be doing half the time.

361
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,972
It seems like I should be wiser.

362
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,759
True wisdom begins when we accept
things as they are.

363
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,986
You started a new age Korra,

364
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:25,138
there's no going back to the past.

365
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:28,129
*** called, the *** found
the new airbender guy.

366
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,255
But when they try to bring him in,

367
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,470
he ran away and climbed to the top
of Kyoshi bridge

368
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,540
and he won't come down.

369
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:36,099
Uh... Sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar
wisdom session?

370
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,909
Avatar wisdom is a thing
of the past, Bolin. Come on.

371
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,079
Oh. Okay.

372
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,488
Is that a good thing?

373
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,140
Depends who you ask.

374
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:59,115
Come down immediately or we will be forced
to take action.

375
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,879
[Panting]

376
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,416
Stay back! I'm dangerous.

377
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,065
Sorry!

378
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,019
Don't panic. I'm just here to talk.

379
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,960
Please, I don't know what I'm doing
and I don't wanna hurt anyone.

380
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:35,982
Tell me about it. Rough day, huh?

381
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,929
I'm having kind of a rough day myself.

382
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:39,587
You mind if I sit down here?

383
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,690
- No.
- I know you're scared.

384
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:46,507
You've gone through a big change and
it's kind of my fault.

385
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:50,850
But you're not alone. There are other
airbenders and they want to help you.

386
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,253
Actually, they're really excited to meet you.

387
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,405
I don't want to be an airbender.

388
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:58,235
Please, you're the Avatar, make it stop.

389
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,769
I'm sorry, I can't.

390
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,275
But I promise you, things will get better

391
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,739
if you just give it a chance.

392
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:09,599
Let me take you over to Air Temple Island
and we can talk this through,

393
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:10,519
okay?

394
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:18,908
[Shouting]

395
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:27,718
[Crowd cheering]

396
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,359
Daw, this is Tenzin.
He's going to help you.

397
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,537
It is absolutely my pleasure
to meet you, Daw.

398
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,417
I've never met a new airbender before.

399
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:40,445
Well, at least not one whose diaper
I didn't have to change.

400
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,554
Actually I just fell off a bridge

401
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,251
so I could use a fresh diaper
right about now.

402
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:48,016
So is this the deal,

403
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:51,377
we have a crisis every other day now
thanks to you?

404
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,531
Listen, I know you're having a tough time
getting used to these changes

405
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:55,857
and I'm sorry for that.

406
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,323
But you and everyone else are gonna
have to learn to live with it.

407
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:02,453
The vines and the spirits are here to stay.

408
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:04,417
Well, you know who's not here to stay?

409
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:06,576
You! I order you to leave this city.

410
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,883
You've caused nothing but trouble
since you arrived.

411
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:15,021
Don't worry, I was already leaving.

412
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:23,628
I can see my path now.

413
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:25,945
There are new airbenders out there and
I'm gonna find them

414
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,540
and rebuild the Air Nation.

415
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:31,056
Don't think I'm not going with you.
It's so exciting.

416
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,152
Who knows who's out there right now,

417
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:36,341
discovering the gift of airbending for
the first time.

418
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,884
You know the drills are here?

419
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,009
Of course.

420
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,607
I hope you still like rice.

421
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,739
Have you ever read the poetry of
the great airbending guru, Lahima?

422
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:17,598
What?

423
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:22,635
Guru Lahima lived 4000 years ago
in the Northern Air Temple.

424
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,869
It is said that he unlocked the secret of
weightlessness

425
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:27,840
and became untethered from the earth,

426
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:31,744
living his final 40 years without ever
touching the ground.

427
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,778
Is that how you plan to escape,

428
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,989
with something you picked up
from an old airbender children's story?

429
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,444
Like all great children's tales,
it contains truth within the myth.

430
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:44,816
Lahima once wrote, instinct is a lie,

431
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:48,416
told by a fearful body hoping to be wrong.

432
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:49,973
What's that supposed to mean?

433
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:54,411
It means that when you base your
expectations only on what you see,

434
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,947
you blind yourself to the possibilities
of a new reality.

435
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:09,203
Unh unh unh, you wouldn't want to singe
your friend, would you?

436
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,624
How?

437
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,582
You're not a bender.

438
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,348
Nature is constantly changing,

439
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:16,987
like the wind.

440
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,747
Now you might wanna ration that
bowl of rice.

441
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:51,182
You've got 3 weeks until
the next shift change.

442
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:53,713
It's the dawning of a new age.

443
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:58,989
The end of the White Lotus and soon,
the end of the Avatar.

444

__

446
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:37,271
Did someone order a fully-equipped 
Future Industries airship?

447
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:38,600
It's perfect.

448
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,689
Thanks, Asami.

449
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,981
I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se
to search for airbenders,

450
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:44,477
we should do it in style.

451
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,985
Yay, airship!

452
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:48,431
- I want to see.
- Come on, Moki.

453
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,671
While you guys are gone, Pema and I 
will hold down the fort.

454
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:56,538
Who's excited to spend some time
with your Auntie Kya?

455
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:58,690
Ew!

456
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,437
Aww. He likes you.

457
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,773
Mako, I'm so glad you're here.

458
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,809
Of course Korra... Avatar.
Avatar Korra.

459
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,802
Once I received your message, I proceeded to
contact various locations

460
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:21,625
within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by
you, the... Avatar.

461
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:26,393
Right. The Avatar... thanks you
for your loyal service.

462
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,812
Did you find any more leads?

463
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:32,760
There are reports of airbenders popping
up all over the Earth Kingdom.

464
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,126
I marked the villages on this map.
You guys can take it with you.

465
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,007
Actually, I was kind of hoping you could
come too.

466
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:45,712
Really? Um... it's probably better
if I sit this one out.

467
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:48,579
I know things have been weird
between us since we broke up,

468
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,358
but you're a part of Team Avatar 
and we can't do this without you.

469
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,567
I'm sorry. I... can't.

470
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,268
I'll miss you, sweetie.

471
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,683
I'll miss you too.

472
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,050
Once we find the airbenders,
I'll send word.

473
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,378
You can join us at the Northern
Air Temple then.

474
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,637
Hey, how come Jinora gets to go with you,
but we don't?

475
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:11,246
That's so not fair!

476
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,592
Yeah, what this girl said, not fair!

477
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:17,227
Because if airbenders show up here,

478
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,223
they're gonna need some guidance
from you two.

479
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:20,941
It's a very important job.

480
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,471
Really? Me, a teacher? Yay!

481
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:28,230

I can't just leave Republic City.

I have a life here and a job.

487

A life? You sleep under your desk.

488
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,334
And what's a more important job than
helping the Avatar

489
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:47,398
rebuild an entire civilization?

490
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,278
It's not just that.

491
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,237
I feel like I've been drifting apart
from everyone.

492
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,450
Well drift back. We need you.

493

Come on, Mako. We're going to Ba Sing Se,
where Dad grew up.

494

What if I meet our grandma for the very first time?

495

And she asks me, "Where is your
sweet brother,"

496
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,996
and I have to say "I'm sorry, Grandma,

police paperwork to file"

and is like,

I can't..."

500
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,485
And then she dies.

Okay, alright. I'll come with you.

Bye. We'll miss you.

505

As of now, these are the towns where
we've gotten reports about airbenders.

506

It looks like we can hit up most of them
before we get to Ba Sing Se.

507
00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:59,536
We're going to bring the Air Nation back

508
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:03,090
from the brink of extinction after
nearly 200 years.

509
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:05,918
And it's all because of you, Korra.

It's nice to see again, Gazan.

Thanks for busting me out.

Where'd you pick up the new skills?

518
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:33,867
I have harmonic convergence to thank for that.

519
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:35,232
I was given a gift.

520
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:38,448
I believe it's a sign that our path
is a righteous one.

521

have you come to our humble village.

Thanks.

I hate to get down to business, but,
is the Airbender here now?

524
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:56,027
Kuon and his family will be joining us
shortly for a special dinner.

525
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,547
Please, right this way.

526
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,238
Kuon has been the talk of the town
ever since he got airbending.

527
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:05,015
He's like a local celebrity.

528
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,083
I just want to say that it's an honor
to meet a fellow Airbender.

529

Oh, I still just think of myself as
a simple farmer...

Oh, I'm so sorry.
I still don't have any control.

532
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:20,860
No worries. I love pie.

533
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,544
And so does Pabu.

534
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,722
Well, you're so much more than
just a farmer now.

535
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,394
Harmonic convergence changed everything.

536
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:33,302
You represent the future of a culture
that is being reborn.

537
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:36,173
You're going to help us rebuild
the Air Nation.

538
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,040
I'm going to do what now?

539
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,468
The only thing I'm planning to
rebuild is my barn.

540
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:44,090
But you must come with us to
the Northern Air Temple.

541
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:47,707
Well, I can't do that.
I have a family and a farm.

542
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,311
Of course you can come.
This is of the utmost importance.

543
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:52,803
Your wife will understand.

Wait, what? No. I do not understand.

Daddy, where are you going?

00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,031
Why does the bald man
want to take you away?

547
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:02,271
No one's going to take
Daddy away, sweetheart.

Actually, this bald man does
want to take him,

549
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:07,040
but it's for an important cause.

550
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:10,420
Your dad is an airbender and
he should learn about his culture.

551
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,069
I think there's been some sort of
misunderstanding.

552
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,508
I'm not going with you.

553
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,117
I might be able to airbend,
but I'm no air-nomad.

554
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,075
I'm no monk.

555

Okay, maybe we should just have
some dessert, huh?

556
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,505
Who's up for dessert?

557
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,090
Sir, you must understand.
You're an airbender now,

558
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:28,802
and there are thousands of years
of culture you must learn about.

559
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,680
Skills you must master.

560
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:33,364
You expect me to abandon my entire life?

561
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:37,575
My family? No! No, sir!
I'm not going anywhere with you

562
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,647
and I think it's best that you leave.

563
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:48,229
In my head I saw that
playing out very differently.

564
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:50,265
Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder

565
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:51,700
to convince him to join us.

566
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,435
Or we could've thrown him into a potato sack

567
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:54,869
and forced him into the ship.

568
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,839
That's how they got me to
join the united forces.

569
00:29:57,841 --> 00:29:59,641
No, we can't coerce people

570
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,710
or throw them in potato sacks.

571
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,178
They must come freely.

572
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,346
But not to worry,

573
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:06,114
there are plenty of other
airbenders out there

574
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,449
who will be happy to come with us

575

once they find out what
the air nation's all about.

We could put on some sort of
airbending street performance.

until he got adopted by a real nice family

801
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:33,067
about six months ago.

802
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,468
And how did he repay them?

803
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,937
By taking their entire life savings.

804
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:38,339
We've been after him ever since.

805
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:39,640
Is that true?

806
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:42,109
The person who stole that
stuff was the old me.

807
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:45,012
Once I got airbending, I changed.

808
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:46,881
I don't know how to explain it,

809
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:49,750
but I feel like airbending
chose me for a reason.

810
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:51,719
Like I'm a new person.

811
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:53,354
I'm sorry! Please!

812
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:56,090
You have to listen to me.

813
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,095
Are you taking him back to the orphanage?

814
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:03,364
No. He's headed to jail.

815
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,667
Wait!

816
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:09,503
You guys got the family's life savings back.

817
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,105
Now let us take Kai.

818
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:13,140
Do you really want our first new member

819
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:16,076
of the air nation to be a liar and a thief?

820
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:18,579
He just needs some guidance, Tenzin.

821
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:20,648
And who better to give it to him than us?

822
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,051
Do you want this kid or not?

823
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:27,221
Yes. You can release the
boy into our custody.

824
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,293
Thank you.

825
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,228
Don't make me regret it.

826
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,698
Welcome to the family, little bro.

827
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,006
I just want you to know,

828
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:47,374
I'm going to be watching you, kid.

829
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,710
I know exactly what you're all about

830
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,478
because I've been there before.

831
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,980
You don't have me fooled.

832
00:41:52,982 --> 00:41:55,549
Whoa, hey, lighten up.

833
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:57,384
I'm turning over a new leaf.

834
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:59,086
Making a change.

835
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:01,622
Don't you worry about me.

836
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:03,691
Hi, I'm Jinora.

837
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,426
If you need any help with airbending

838
00:42:05,428 --> 00:42:06,827
I could show you what I know.

839
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,396
Thanks. That's real nice of you.

840
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:12,533
Jinora! We're leaving now.

841
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,652
They came out of nowhere.
I'm so sorry, Lord Zuko.

842
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:33,954
How could you let this happen?

843
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:36,090
They caught us by surprise.

844
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:38,392
And Zaheer is an airbender now.

845
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,928
No! This can't be.

846
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,832
Do you have any idea the
power these criminals possess?

847
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:47,434
Individually, they can take down any bender.

848
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:48,869
Put them all together,

849
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:51,438
they could take down the entire world.

850
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,842
And now you're telling me
their leader is an airbender?

851
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:55,876
We can track them...

852
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,244
We don't need to track them.

853
00:42:57,246 --> 00:42:59,046
I know exactly where they're going.

854
00:42:59,048 --> 00:43:01,649
Notify the new chiefs of
the Northern watertribe

855
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:04,485
that an attack on their prison is imminent.

856
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:07,688
And send word to Lin
Beifong in Republic City.

857
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,925
The Avatar must be protected.

858
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:13,694
Where are you going?

859
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:16,563
To stop them.

860
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:26,814
