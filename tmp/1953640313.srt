1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,086
Earth.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,463
Fire.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,009
Air.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,804
Water.

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,810
When I was a boy,
my father, Avatar Aang,

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,979
toId me the story
of how he and his friends

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,441
heroicaIIy ended the Hundred Year War.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,987
Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko
transformed the Fire Nation colonies

9
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,364
into the United RepubIic of Nations,

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,325
a society where benders
and non-benders

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,123
from all over the world could live and
thrive together in peace and harmony.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,544
They named the capitaI of this
great land Republic City.

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,592
Avatar Aang accompIished
many remarkabIe things in his Iife.

14
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:55,054
But sadIy, his time in this world
came to an end.

15
00:00:55,138 --> 00:01:00,267
And Iike the cycIe of the seasons,
the cycIe of the Avatar began anew.

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,959
The White Lotus has
honored my family by coming.

17
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,503
Thank you.

18
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,049
Welcome.

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,180
We have investigated many claims,
both here and in the Northern Tribe.

20
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,516
All have turned out to be false.

21
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,561
Then you should be happy to know
your search has come to an end.

22
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,023
What makes you so sure
your daughter is the one?

23
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,859
Korra, please come in here.

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,491
l'm the Avatar. You got to deal with it.

25
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,661
She's strong.

26
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,621
She lacks restraint.

27
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,146
Hey, why all the doom and gloom,
people?

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,023
We should be celebrating!

29
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,192
Three elements down, one to go.

30
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,944
You're getting ahead of yourself
as usual, Korra.

31
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,572
We haven't decided if you passed
your firebending test yet.

32
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,990
Ever since you were a little girl,

33
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,201
you've excelled
at the physical side of bending,

34
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,329
but completely ignored
the spiritual side.

35
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,081
The Avatar must master both.

36
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,168
l haven't ignored it,
it just doesn't come as easy to me.

37
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,504
But that's why l should start training
with Tenzin immediately.

38
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,173
He's Mr. Spiritual.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,634
Do you believe she's ready,
Master Katara?

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:44,056
Yes, if anyone can teach her what she
needs to learn, it's Tenzin.

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,515
Very well, Korra.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,352
lt's time for you to begin
your airbending training.

43
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,771
Yes! Finally!

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:57,194
l mean, thank you all for believing in me.

45
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,786
Naga, you should've seen it.

46
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,747
l kicked some Firebender butt.

47
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,290
And l passed.

48
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,542
Tenzin will be here in a few days.

49
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,552
Just taking Naga out for a stroll.

50
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,890
Don't worry, we're not going far.

51
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,155
Naga, go! Thatta girl!

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,824
Go, go, go!

53
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,167
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

54
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,627
Are we there yet?
lt looks like we're there.

55
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,629
l know this. This is very familiar.
Are we here yet?

56
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,839
Are we here yet?

57
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,966
-Please tell me we're here!
-Yes, lkki.

58
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,260
As l've been telling you
for the last 1 5 minutes,

59
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,596
we are finally here.

60
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,142
Hello, Mother.

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,437
l can't tell you how happy l am
to see you.

62
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,188
Please... Help me.

63
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,275
Unhand me, strange woman!

64
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,110
That's your grandmother, Meelo.

65
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,533
lt's so good to see all of you.

66
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,953
Gran-Gran, l've been reading
all about your old adventures,

67
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,455
l've been dying to ask you.

68
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,290
What happened to Zuko's mom?

69
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,126
Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale...

70
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,879
Gran-Gran, you look old.
How old are you?

71
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,672
And why is it so cold in the South Pole?

72
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,591
Can we make a campfire
and all huddle around it,

73
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,301
and tell scary stories
and make snowmen?

74
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,304
And then can you make the snowmen
move with waterbending and chase us?

75
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,806
Wouldn't that be fun? Wouldn't it?

76
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,477
Pema, let me help you.
Careful, now. Careful.

77
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,481
Stop doting on me.
l'm not helpless, l'm just pregnant.

78
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,652
The baby's strong.

79
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,697
l see another Airbender in your future.

80
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,784
All l want is one child like me.

81
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,288
A nice non-bender, who doesn't blast
wind in my face every five seconds.

82
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,333
Mommy, look! l'm a Snowbender!

83
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,714
Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy
when they were kids?

84
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,591
Kya and Bumi certainly were,

85
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,345
but Tenzin has always
been rather serious.

86
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,347
Mother, please.

87
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,351
Korra?

88
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,896
Look at you. So big and strong.

89
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,815
You've grown into quite
the young Avatar.

90
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,361
Master Tenzin, l'm so glad you're here.
l can't wait to get started.

91
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,363
Yes, well.

92
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,574
You're going to have to tell her
sooner or later.

93
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,867
Wait, tell me what?

94
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,370
You're not staying, are you?

95
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,666
l'm afraid not.
We're only visiting for the night.

96
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,460
Then l have to return to Republic City.

97
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:05,507
But, no, you're supposed to move here.
You're supposed to teach me.

98
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,384
l'm sorry, Korra.

99
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,345
Your airbending training
is going to have to wait.

100
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,061
So how long until you're
ready to teach me airbending?

101
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,521
A week? A month?

102
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,690
lt could be much longer.

103
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,275
l don't understand.

104
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,401
Why are you making me wait?

105
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,405
l have a responsibility to Republic City.
l'm one of its leaders.

106
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,324
And the situation there
is very unstable right now.

107
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,953
But you also have a responsibility
to teach me.

108
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,206
Believe me, l'd be happy
to find another airbending master,

109
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,624
but you're the only one.

110
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,084
We're stuck with each other.

111
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,752
l wish there were another way.

112
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,421
Wait, there is!

113
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,797
lf you can't stay here,

114
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,383
then l'll go back to Republic City
with you.

115
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,468
lt's perfect!

116
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,428
Absolutely not!

117
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,346
The city is far too dangerous.

118
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,224
Avatar Aang tasked us
with keeping you safe

119
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,351
while you mastered the four elements.

120
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,563
l get that, but l don't think keeping me
locked up in this compound

121
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,690
like a prisoner is what he had in mind.

122
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,901
l know this is difficult to accept,

123
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,445
but it's not the right time
for you to come to the city.

124
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,946
Whatever.

125
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,495
Goodbye, Gran-Gran.

126
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,580
Oogi, yip yip.

127
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,488
Nice night for an escape, isn't it?

128
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,533
l have to leave.

129
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,244
l have to find my own path as the Avatar.

130
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,663
l know you do.

131
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,251
Aang's time has passed.

132
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,629
My brother and many of my friends
are gone.

133
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,925
lt's time for you and your generation
to take on the responsibility

134
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,512
of keeping peace and balance
in the world.

135
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,391
And l think you're going to be
a great Avatar.

136
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,725
Thank you.

137
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,186
Goodbye, Korra.

138
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,075
Mom, Dad...

139
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,537
l'll miss you.

140
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,581
We love you so much.

141
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,951
Naga, we're here!

142
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,213
Thanks for the ride!

143
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,224
Wow, look at this place.

144
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,269
l've never seen so many Sato-mobiles.

145
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,492
Air Temple lsland.
That's where Tenzin lives.

146
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,452
You ready for a little swim, girl?

147
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,580
Okay, okay!

148
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,249
Food first, then Air Temple.

149
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,002
Watch it, Naga! Look out!

150
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,632
Watch where you're going!

151
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,717
Sorry about that. Excuse us.

152
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,636
Coming through. Heads up.

153
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,137
Sorry, we're new in town.

154
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,814
Naga, wait.

155
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,944
We'll take one of everything, please.

156
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,654
That'll be 20 yuans.

157
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,740
l don't have any money.

158
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,492
Then what good are you to me?

159
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,664
Don't worry, girl. This city's huge.

160
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,667
l bet we can find a place to rustle up
something to eat.

161
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,228
Say, think l can get one of them
tasty-smelling fishies?

162
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,481
Yeah, sure!

163
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:20,113
So do you live in that bush?

164
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,408
Yes, presently that is
what l do call home.

165
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,786
Took me a while to procure a bush
that beauteous.

166
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,706
This park is quite popular
with all the vagabonds.

167
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,834
So there are a lot of you out here?

168
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,503
l thought everyone in this city
was living it up.

169
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,215
You got a lot to learn, newcomer.

170
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,050
Welcome to Republic City!

171
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,722
Hey, you! Stop! You can't fish here!

172
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,600
You best skedaddle!

173
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,697
Are you tired of Iiving under the
tyranny of benders?

174
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,741
Then join the EquaIists!

175
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,326
For too Iong,

176
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,746
the bending eIite of this city
have forced non-benders

177
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,040
to live as lower-class citizens.

178
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,711
Join Amon, and together we wiII tear
down the bending estabIishment!

179
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,087
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,256
Bending is the coolest thing
in the world.

181
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,802
Oh, yeah?
Let me guess, you're a bender.

182
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,470
Yeah, l am.

183
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,431
And I bet you'd just Iove to
knock me off this pIatform

184
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,225
with some waterbending, huh?

185
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,560
l'm seriously thinking about it.

186
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,771
This is what's wrong with the city.

187
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,817
Benders Iike this girl
onIy use their power to oppress us!

188
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,778
What?

189
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,366
l'm not oppressing anyone.
You're oppressing yourself.

190
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,618
That didn't even make sense.

191
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,960
Excuse me, l think l'm lost.

192
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,337
How do l get to Air Temple lsland
from here?

193
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,256
Just head down this street...

194
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,802
You should get moving, young lady.
lt isn't safe.

195
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,810
Mr. Chung, please tell me
that you have my money,

196
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,939
or else l can't guarantee
l can protect your fine establishment.

197
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,109
l'm sorry.
Business has been slow. Please.

198
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,652
Take one of my phonographs.

199
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,825
My friend here is not a music lover.

200
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,660
Give me the money, or else...

201
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,829
Or else what, hoodlum?

202
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,465
Since you're obviously fresh off the boat,

203
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,843
let me explain a couple things.

204
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,596
You're in Triple Threat Triad territory,

205
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,016
and we're about to put you
in the hospital.

206
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,226
You're the only ones who are going
to need a hospital.

207
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,229
And for your sake,
l hope there's one nearby.

208
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,939
Who do you think you are?

209
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,317
Why don't you come and find out?

210
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,581
-What just happened?
-Did she just earthbend?

211
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,053
-Can she firebend, too?
-Could she be...

212
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,729
Got an idea about
who l am now, chumps?

213
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,485
Come on!

214
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,364
You're not getting away.

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,463
PoIice! Freeze where you are!

216
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,304
Cool. Metalbenders.

217
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,940
l caught the bad guys for you, Officers.

218
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,274
Arrest them.

219
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,864
You're under arrest, too.

220
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,831
What do you mean l'm under arrest?

221
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,917
Those are the bad guys over there.
They were smashing up a shop.

222
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,837
From the looks of it, you smashed up
a lot more than that.

223
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,340
Wait, you can't arrest me.
Let me explain.

224
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,719
You can explain yourself all you like
down at headquarters.

225
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,041
Let's see.

226
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,504
MuItipIe counts of destruction of private
and city property.

227
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,590
Not to mention evading arrest.

228
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,426
You're in a whole mess of trouble,
young lady.

229
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,804
But there were some thugs
threatening a helpless shopkeeper

230
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,097
-and l had to...
-Can it!

231
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,058
You should have called the police
and stayed out of the way.

232
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,896
But l couldn't just sit by and do nothing.
lt's my duty to help people.

233
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,856
See, l'm the Avatar.

234
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,609
Oh, l am well aware of who you are.

235
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,447
And your "Avatar" title might impress
some people, but not me.

236
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,491
All right. Fine.

237
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,077
Then l want to talk to
whoever's in charge.

238
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,080
You're talking to her. l'm Chief Beifong.

239
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,415
Wait. Beifong?

240
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,876
Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!

241
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,961
What of it?

242
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,213
Well, then why are you treating me
like a criminal?

243
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,549
Avatar Aang and your mother
were friends.

244
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,092
They saved the world together.

245
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,760
That's ancient history.

246
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,097
And it's got diddly-squat to do
with the mess you're in right now.

247
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,890
You can't just waltz in here

248
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,935
and dole out vigilante justice
like you own the place.

249
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,272
Chief. Councilman Tenzin is here.

250
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,816
Let him in.

251
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,028
Tenzin.

252
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,283
Sorry, l got a little sidetracked
on my way to see you.

253
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,788
Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.

254
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,331
Cut the garbage, Tenzin.

255
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,542
Why is the Avatar in Republic City?

256
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,043
l thought you were supposed to be

257
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,045
moving down to the South Pole
to train her.

258
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,506
My relocation has been delayed.

259
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,134
The Avatar, on the other hand,

260
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,636
will be heading back
to the South Pole immediately.

261
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,680
-Where she will stay put.
-But...

262
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,432
lf you would be so kind

263
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,143
as to drop the charges against Korra,

264
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,813
l will take full responsibility
for today's regrettable events

265
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,232
and cover all the damages.

266
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,155
Fine. Get her out of my city.

267
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,158
Always a pleasure, Lin. Let's go, Korra.

268
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Tenzin, please.

269
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't send me back home.

270
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,382
You blatantly disobeyed my wishes,
and the Orders of the White Lotus.

271
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,593
Katara agreed with me
that l should come.

272
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,179
She said my destiny is in Republic City.

273
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,223
Don't bring my mother into this!

274
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,434
Look, l can't wait any longer
to finish my training.

275
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,311
Being cooped up and hidden away
from the world

276
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,022
isn't helping me become a better Avatar.

277
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:37,526
l saw a lot of the city today
and it's totally out of whack.

278
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,528
l understand now why you need to stay.

279
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,864
Republic City does need you.

280
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,324
But it needs me, too!

281
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,206
ls this your polar bear-dog, miss?

282
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,570
-Korra!
-Korra!

283
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,241
Are you coming to live with us
on the lsland?

284
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,160
No, l'm sorry, lkki.

285
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,578
l have to go home now.

286
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,795
Wait.

287
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,840
l have done my best
to guide Republic City

288
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,259
towards the dream my father had for it.

289
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,929
But you are right, it has fallen
out of balance since he passed.

290
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,558
l thought l should put off your training
in order to uphold his legacy.

291
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,185
But you are his legacy.

292
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,689
You may stay and train
airbending here with me.

293
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,275
Republic City needs its Avatar
once again.

294
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,361
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!

295
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:24,300
HeIIo? I'm Korra, your new Avatar.

296
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,719
Does this mean you've moved
to Republic City?

297
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,305
Were you trying to send a message
to the Triads yesterday?

298
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,975
Will you be fighting crime or
the anti-bending revolution? Or both?

299
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,478
Will you be working with Chief Beifong
and the police?

300
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,191
Yes, I am definiteIy here to stay,
but, honestIy...

301
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,693
I don't exactIy have a pIan yet.

302
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,071
See, l'm still in training, but...

303
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:49,075
Look, aII I know is Avatar Aang
meant for this city

304
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,745
to be the center of peace
and balance in the world.

305
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:57,333
And l believe we can make
his dream a reaIity.

306
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,252
I Iook forward to serving you.

307
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,340
I'm so happy to be here.
Thank you, Republic City.

308
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,384
AII right, that's aII the questions the...

309
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,762
Amon, how do you want to handle this?

310
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,973
So the Avatar has arrived early.

311
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,352
lt looks like we will have to accelerate
our plans.
